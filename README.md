Project Title: CityClean Kelowna

The app will reward citizens of kelowna for picking up litter around the city. There will be 2 options in the app.

Option 1) Picking up litter

● Take a photo of the litter and where you found it. Take a photo of you dropping it off in a garbage or recycling bin.

● Reward: 1 ‘KelownaToken’ to be used at participating small businesses.

Option 2) Reporting litter

● Take a photo of the litter and drop a pin on a map of kelowna.

● 5 Litter reports = 1 ‘KelownaToken’

The app will feature an open source map that shows the locations of reported pieces of litter so that residents can help each other find litter and keep the city clean.
